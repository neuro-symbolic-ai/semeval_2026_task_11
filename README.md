### The Challenge: Content Biases in LLMs

A major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to confuse formal logical validity with the plausibility of arguments. This phenomenon, known as the **content effect**, means LLMs often:

* Overestimate the validity of arguments that align with common knowledge.

* Underestimate the validity of arguments that seem implausible, even if they are logically sound.

This issue highlights a fundamental problem: the pre-training process inherently entangles reasoning with content, limiting the reliability and application of LLMs in critical real-world scenarios. While various methods have been proposed to address this, a truly effective solution remains elusive, especially across different languages.

### A Multilingual Evaluation of Content Effect on Reasoning

SemEval-2026 Task 11 aims to tackle this challenge by focusing on **multilingual syllogistic reasoning**. Participants will build models that can assess the formal validity of logical arguments, completely independent of their plausibility, across a variety of languages.

To achieve this, we will release a novel, large-scale dataset of syllogistic arguments. This dataset will help us measure not only a model's accuracy but also how the content effect manifests and varies across different languages.

We encourage participants to explore solutions based on natively multilingual open-source or open-weight models that offer insights into the internal reasoning mechanisms.

### Task Overview

This task consists of four subtasks that build on each other, moving from a simple English setting to a complex multilingual one with distracting information. The competition will be hosted on **Codabench**.

#### Training Data

The training set is exclusively in English to simulate a low-resource setting. Arguments are categorized by both `validity` (true/false) and `plausibility` (true/false), though the goal is always to predict validity.

**Example from the training set:**

```json
{
    "id": "0",
    "syllogism": "Not all canines are aquatic creatures known as fish. It is certain that no fish belong to the class of mammals. Therefore, every canine falls under the category of mammals.",
    "validity": false,
    "plausibility": true
}
```

* **Note:** The model must correctly predict `validity: false`, ignoring the `plausibility: true` (which is based on world knowledge).

---

#### Subtask 1: Syllogistic Reasoning in English

* **Goal:** Determine the formal validity of syllogisms in English.

* **Metrics:**

  * **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct validity predictions.

  * **Content Effect:** The difference in accuracy between plausible and implausible syllogisms. A lower score is better.

* **Ranking:** Based on the ratio of Accuracy to Content Effect. A higher ratio indicates a more robust model.

---

#### Subtask 2: Syllogistic Reasoning with Irrelevant Premises in English

* **Goal:** Determine validity while filtering out "noisy" or irrelevant premises in English.

* **Metrics:**

  * **Binary Prediction:** Same accuracy and content effect metrics as Subtask 1.

  * **Premise Selection:** An F1 score to measure the model's ability to identify relevant premises.
    
* **Ranking:** Based on the ratio of Accuracy and F1 to Content Effect. A higher ratio indicates a more robust model.
---

#### Subtask 3: Multilingual Syllogistic Reasoning

* **Goal:** Extend binary classification to multiple languages.

* **Metrics:**

  * **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct validity predictions in each language.

  * **Multilingual Content Effect:** A composite score that measures both content effect within a target language and the difference in content effect between that language and English.

* **Ranking:** Based on the ratio of Accuracy to Multilingual Content Effect.

---

#### Subtask 4: Multilingual Syllogistic Reasoning with Irrelevant Premises

* **Goal:** Handle noisy, irrelevant premises in multiple languages.

* **Metrics:**

  * **Binary Prediction:** Same accuracy and content effect metrics as Subtask 2.

  * **Premise Selection:** F1 score for identifying relevant premises.

* **Ranking:** Based on the ratio of Accuracy and F1 to Multilingual Content Effect.
